Overview
--------

The **Pure Storage Fusion Python SDK** is a python module that simplifies
integration with the Pure Storage Fusion REST interface.

It wraps REST calls with simple APIs and abstracts the HTTP request and
response handling.

This documentation should be supplemental and attempts to explain installation,
basic usage, and provides a glossary of the exposed APIs.
